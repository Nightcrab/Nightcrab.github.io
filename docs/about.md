## About Me

I am a computer science student with an interest in Artificial Intelligence and HPC. My work mainly covers questions such as:

1. What is the optimal hardware to suit a particular model or algorithm? And conversely, given hardware constraints, what algorithm is ideal?

2. How can we scale AI programs at inference time, for example, using search?

3. What complex domains can we apply Deep Learning to, or develop specialised DNNs to solve?

4. What are the limits of combining Monte Carlo methods with DNNs?

## About This Blog

This blog contains discussions of my research, projects and discussions of topics or ideas that I have found interesting (usually in computer science or mathematics).

The site was developed by me in plain HTML5, with the use of Marked to render markdown files. It is hosted on GitHub Pages.
